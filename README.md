# Discord css-snippets
A set of snippets aimed to enhance the Discord client. Some of them are for general use, but others are more personalized to me. Check out each folder for more info about the snippet.

## My settings
This import is the snippets that I use myself.
```css
@import url(//whyimicro.github.io/css-snippets/import.css);
```
## My settings (Compact mode)
This import is almost the same as the one above, but without 2 snippets that ruin the compact experience.
```css
@import url(//whyimicro.github.io/css-snippets/compactImport.css);
```
