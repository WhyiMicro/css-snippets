# Hide elements

Hide's a lot of elements from the discord client. Many of which I deem unnecessary or annoying. <br>
List of hidden elements:

- Nitro store button
- Discord game library
- Notification settings button
- Help button

## Installation

To install this snippet, simply copy the line bellow into your custom css file:

```css
