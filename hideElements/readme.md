# Hide elements
Hide's a lot of elements from the discord client. Many of which I deem unnecessary or annoying. <br>
List of hidden elements:
* Nitro store button
* Discord game library
* Notification settings button
* Help button
* Nitro badge on banner
* Gift button
* Sticker button
* Scrollbar in message section
* Scrollbar in channel section
(ðŸ‘ˆ It also adds a margin fix for this)
## Installation
